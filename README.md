# Intelligent-Cpu-scheduling-simulator

A CPU Scheduling Simulator is a computer program that simulates and visualizes different CPU scheduling algorithms, which are used to decide the sequence in which processes are executed by the central processing unit (CPU) of an operating system. CPU scheduling is used to allocate CPU time to multiple processes or tasks in an efficient and equitable way so that the system can run optimally.
